## Performance Results

The performance results for different attempts are shown in the following table:

| Attempt | #1 | #2 | #3 | #4 | #5 | #6 | #7 | #8 | #9 | #10 | #11 | #12 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Seconds | 301 | 283 | 290 | 286 | 289 | 285 | 287 | ... |

## Dataset

The dataset used in the study consists of 2000 small molecule compounds. The original dataset can be found here: [dataset/Dragon_2000cpds.csv](dataset/Dragon_2000cpds.csv).

## Scripts

The following scripts are provided in this repository:

1. [1-RFcls_main_latest.py](1-RFcls_main_latest.py): Run this script for classification and to obtain evaluation results.
2. [categorical_index.py](categorical_index.py): Required module for over-sampling.
3. [2-plot_feature_importance_ver2.py](2-plot_feature_importance_ver2.py): Modified plotting script for feature importance.
